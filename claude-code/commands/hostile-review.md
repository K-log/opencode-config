description: Adversarial code review that hunts for real, verifiable bugs, then verifies each finding with a fresh neutral subagent before reporting.
argument-hint: [file(s), directory, glob, or diff ref]
---

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS` — optional file(s), directory, glob, or diff ref to scope the review.

This is a read-only review. Do not edit, fix, or modify any files — only report findings.

**Resolve scope:**

1. If `$ARGUMENTS` is given, split it on whitespace into one or more tokens.
   - If every token resolves to an existing file, directory, or glob match on disk, treat them together as the literal scope — this disk-existence check takes priority over the ref rules below so relative paths like `../shared/utils.ts` are never misread as a git ref, and space-separated multi-file input (e.g. `src/a.ts src/b.ts`) resolves correctly instead of being treated as one invalid token.
   - Otherwise, if there is exactly one token and it contains `..` (e.g. `main..feature`), treat it as a git ref range and run `git diff <ref-range> --stat` to resolve the file list.
   - Otherwise, if there is exactly one token, treat it as a single git ref (e.g. `main`, `HEAD~3`, a commit SHA) and run `git diff <ref> --stat` to resolve the file list.
2. If no arguments are given: run `git diff HEAD --stat`. If that errors (e.g. no commits yet), fall back to `git diff --stat` instead.
3. If scope is still empty or ambiguous after the above (including multi-token `$ARGUMENTS` where not every token resolved as a path), ask the user which files/directory/ref to review before continuing via the `AskUserQuestion` tool.

**Pass 1 — Hostile review (you):**

Treat this code as some of the worst you've seen. Assume it is broken and do not extend good faith. You are hunting concrete bugs, not style opinions.

1. Read every target file in full. Do not skim.
2. Hunt for concrete defects: logic errors, off-by-one errors, null/undefined handling, race conditions, resource/memory leaks, broken error handling, security holes, unhandled edge cases, type mismatches, dead/unreachable code, and contract mismatches between caller and callee.
3. Verify before listing anything:
   - Trace the exact code path that triggers each suspected issue.
   - Prove it where you can: run the project's linter/type-checker/tests (e.g. `tsc`, `eslint`, `pytest`, `cargo check`) or construct the specific input/state that breaks it.
   - Drop anything you cannot trace to a concrete trigger. No "this might be an issue" — either it reproduces from reading the code, or it does not go on the list.
4. Write a concise findings list: one entry per issue with `file:line`, a one-sentence description of the concrete failure mode, and the evidence that proves it.

**Pass 2 — Neutral verification (subagent):**

For each Pass 1 finding, dispatch a fresh, independent subagent (Task tool, subagent type `Explore`). It is read-only by design — Write/Edit are denied at the tool level, so the "no edits" constraint is structural here, not just an instruction. It must have no memory of the "worst code" framing above. Give it only:

- The file(s) and line range in question.
- The claimed defect, phrased as a neutral hypothesis to check: "Determine whether X actually occurs at file:line. Do not assume it is real — verify by re-reading the referenced code and tracing the exact logic path."
- Instructions to return: confirmed / partially confirmed / disputed, its supporting evidence (the traced code path, not just an opinion), and — only if confirmed or partially confirmed — a severity: `critical` (crash, data loss, security), `high` (wrong behavior on a common path), `medium` (wrong behavior on an edge case), `low` (real but cosmetic/maintainability only).

If the neutral subagent cannot re-run a linter/type-checker/test that Pass 1 used as evidence, it verifies by code inspection only — it re-derives the same conclusion by reading the code path that command would exercise, and states plainly that it verified by inspection rather than execution.

Findings are independent — dispatch all of them in a single message so they run in parallel.

**Output:**

Present every Pass 1 finding in one markdown table, including ones the neutral pass disputed:

| Severity | File:Line | Issue | Evidence | Neutral Verdict |
| -------- | --------- | ----- | -------- | --------------- |

- `Neutral Verdict` always states the verdict word (`Confirmed`, `Partially confirmed`, or `Disputed`) followed by the agent's reasoning.
- Confirmed and partially confirmed findings sort together, ordered by severity (critical → high → medium → low); disputed findings sort last.
- For disputed findings, set `Severity` to `Disputed`.
- If Pass 1 found nothing, say so plainly and stop — do not invent findings to fill the table.
